# Predicting The Prices Of Cars

This project serves as an introduction to machine learning. The task is to predict the prices of cars. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data) and information about the dataset is found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).

**Objective:** The objective is to identify the best model to predict the prices of cars. Specifically, we want to reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

**Techniques used:**
* sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.metrics
* pandas, numpy
* Univariate K-nearest neighbour model
* Multivariate K-nearest neighbour model
* Data normalization
* Matplotlib
* Data visualization
